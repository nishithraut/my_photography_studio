      <h3>About Nishith</h3>
      <hr />

      <p>
        Ever since I, <strong>Nishith Raut</strong>{" "}, first picked up a camera, 
        I’ve been chasing stories — not the kind told in words, but the ones
        whispered by the wild. A tech enthusiast by mind and a wildlife
        photographer by heart, I found my calling in bringing the wonders of
        nature closer to people who may never get the chance to witness them in
        person.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a world where climate change has shifted from quiet conversations to
        an undeniable crisis, my mission is simple yet urgent: to bridge the gap
        between human life and the natural world. To me, development that comes
        at the cost of the environment isn’t progress at all — it’s an exchange
        of life for luxury.

      <p>
        One of my dream projects, to visit all Wildlife Parks, lives vividly in
        my mind — a monumental journey to all 55 tiger reserves in India. Though
        yet to be undertaken, I envision covering thousands of kilometers,
        immersing myself in diverse landscapes, and documenting the beauty,
        challenges, and conservation stories of these wild havens. My goal is to
        raise awareness about the importance of preserving India’s wildlife
        before it’s too late.
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, I continue to hone my craft, building the skills, experience,
        and vision needed to make Project ATR a reality. Every photograph I take
        is a step toward that dream — a promise that one day, I will tell these
        stories to the world in a way that inspires both awe and action.

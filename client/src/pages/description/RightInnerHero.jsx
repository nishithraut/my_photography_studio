      <h2>Nishith Raut</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Still a student but already deeply passionate about photography, Nishith
        Raut began his journey behind the lens as a simple hobby. What started
        as casual clicks soon turned into a pursuit to capture stories,
        emotions, and moments that often go unnoticed. With an eye for detail
        and a love for experimenting with perspectives, he is constantly
        exploring ways to grow and refine his craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though early in his career and working independently, Nishith carries a
        strong ambition to leave a mark in the world of photography. Each frame
        he takes is a step toward building his own unique style â€” one that
        reflects both curiosity and creativity. Driven, self-taught, and eager
        to learn, he sees every shot as an opportunity to evolve as an artist
        and storyteller.
